                <h3>HOW DID I GROW? &#127794;</h3>
                <p>Completing the <a href="https://emoticon.mouse.org/" target="_blank">EMOTICON</a> game was a moment that I felt my hard work paid off, it was the first real thing I've accomplished with Python that wasn't strictly guided by a program. I approached it with careful planning and was able to learn more about what goes into graphics, programming, and game design. While I still don't know everything at this point in my journey, and while there's always room for improvement, I'm more confident to tackle bigger and more complex problems now that my knowledge has grown.</p>

                <h3>ENJOYABLE PROJECTS &#128295;</h3>
                <p>As for projects I found enjoyable, the <a href="animation.html" target="_blank">animation</a> and <a href="avatar.html" target="_blank">avatar</a> working with python graphics were appealing because they combined art and coding in a coherent manner, two interests of mine that I enjoy very much. I understood more about overlapping shapes and how they come together to create images appealing to a person's mind. I did struggle a little when it came to time, but by allocating my days for specific aspects of the animation and avatar made it a little more bearable, allowing me to build upon my time management skills.</p>

                <h3>GROUP COLLABORATION &#128107;</h3>
                <p>There's been a lot of group work persistent throughout the year, which allowed me to build lasting relationships with my classmates and peers. For example, the <a href="https://pencil.org/blog/pencils-app-creation-competitions/" target="_blank">INFY APP challenge</a> placed us into groups where I could contribute my knowledge, and everyone could contribute theirs, combining it into one coherent project where all of our talents shined. I was the graphic designer and created a bunch of the photos and helped with colors, making the presentation slides and application appealing to the eye.</p>

                <h3>WHAT'S NEXT? &#127912;</h3>
                <p>As for my personal goals next year, I want to get better at different kinds of programming, which includes Javascript. I plan to achieve them by trying my best in the upcoming year and getting a head start over the summer, completing internships and researching videos to watch on my own time. It's appealing to me because coding is something I want to do when I'm older. As for advice, I'd advise myself earlier in the year to not stress out too much and try to have fun with what you do, because that way it's less daunting.</p>

                <h3>FUTURE CAREER &#128188;</h3>
                <p>For my future career, I hope to be able to further the knowledge I have currently in order to get a degree in computer science and a minor in either digital arts or psychology. I'd like to continue this path, becoming a UX/UI, app, or website designer, being able to make a change in the world through my work and making it an overall better place. Thus, psychology or digital arts will allow me to understand how my work can impact the people around me, or how to design digital graphics in a coherent manner, while computer science allows me to comprehend the logistics.</p>

                <h3>OVERALL REFLECTION &#128214;</h3>
                <p>I feel like my projects this year have been pretty good, despite certain stressors and time constraints that I felt were impossible to meet I was able to complete almost everything in a timely fashion. Learning to enjoy myself and have fun with it is something I'll take over to next year, and the next, so that things don't stress me out too much and I can fully enjoy the thing I want to do in the future. In all, this school year has been enlightening and allowed me to build upon personal skills that go much further than just coding.</p>
