            <h1>AVATAR PROJECT</h1>
            <p>The project I made was based on stylized icons. The image I created is something I'm very proud of, to the point where I've also decided to utilize it as this website's favicon. Though there was some inconsistency with the concept of coding an actual person, compared to a landscape which I thought would be easier, I was able to complete it. Overall, I'm proud of the end product.</p>

                <h3>NOTES</h3>
                <p>You may need to fork the repl once you open it in order to view the code. This was done JUNIOR year.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on both my understanding of how graphics can be created using Python and got to try it first hand myself. It was a learning experience that I enjoyed because of the creativity.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Figuring out how to layer at first was difficult, but I soon got the hang of it and was able to produce what I wanted by asking my peers for help with the code. After understanding the assignment, I completed something I was proud of.</p>
