                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on my understanding of javascript and implementing features to the site that I normally wouldn't. It forced me outside of my comfort zone and I'm proud of what I made.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Figuring out javascript was difficult because I set the high standards of both filtering the animals by their species, temperament, etc. as well as creating a carousel for the staff members. It was difficult but rewarding as I utilized the internet to help me understand.</p>
