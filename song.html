            <h1>EARSKETCH SONG</h1>
            <p>The Build-A-Beat challenge was one I entered, where Python had to be used in conjunction with looped sounds to create a coherent piece. It was challenging because it was something I've only ever done once before with Python.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on my EarSketch skills. It allowed me to better understand how exactly the code comes into place, because I haven't used this program often.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Figuring out how to get the snares in sync was hard, however I was able to overcome it by searching up tutorials and trying to understand exactly what each line of code does.</p>
