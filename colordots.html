            <h2>P1 COLORED DOTS</h2>
            <p>As an introduction to Python, my Python & Programming class had us experiment with what Python can do and produce colored dots whereever the mouse is tracked.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Because this project was my first real lab within my programming class, it was interesting to experiment with what Python can do. I was slightly familiar with JavaScript but not Python, and coding this was a fun experience that taught me a lot.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>The class went fast and I found myself falling behind a lot, but thanks to my tablemates I was able to get back on track by asking questions for clarification. I eventually gained footing and found it enjoyable.</p>
