            <h1>CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE</h1>
            <p>In a group of three people, myself, Jaunel Deans, and Tristan Katwaroo, we created a game called "SoulSearch" to promote mental wellness in teenagers through the gameification of understanding coping mechanisms and utilizing them in their day-to-day lives.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've learned how to compromise with teammates, furthering my project management skills and taking on a role of "psuedo team leader" by making sure everyone was on task. It was a new, fun, and rewarding experience to work passionately alongside my peers.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Time management was difficult as we only had less than a week to work on the project, which meant cutting corners and leaving me less satisfied. However, we did what we could with the time we had.</p>
