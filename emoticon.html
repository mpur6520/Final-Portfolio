                <p>You may need to click the play button twice in order for the game to launch. Additionally, you can move the preview window for a better view! This was done JUNIOR year.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>The project was challenging yet fun, especially because I made every aspect of the game personally. I wanted to challenge myself for my first game in Python, making the art, music, and coding it. While it was difficult, having it be completed, even with its flaws, was greatly rewarding.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>The time constraint was difficult because I found myself constantly overestimating what I could do in the timeframe, especially because I had to work on it outside of class. However, I was able to contact my teacher over break and get everything working thanks to her.</p>
