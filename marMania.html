            <h1>MARBLE MANIA</h1>
            <p>In my senior year Project & Prototyping class, our teacher introduced us to Unity, in which we would all follow a curated course to create two distinct games. One of these games was a marble race.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on my Unity and C# skills by being consistently introduced to aspects of the programming language I was unfamiliar with in the past. The process of designing the course was fun.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Due to my unfamiliarity with Unity, it was a struggle to navigate the panels at first. Once I got the hang of it and learned about new features, the process gradually became easier.</p>
