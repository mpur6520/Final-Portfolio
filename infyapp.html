            <h2>INFY APP CHALLENGE</h2>
            <p>The Infosys Foundation USA's "Infy App Challenge" is a competition that challenges students to design an app to address a social issue in their community. Together with three other classmates, my group designed "LeafFree", an app designed for recovering addicts.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>This app spanned across several months and was both challenging and a fun experience. I learned a lot about how to cater to users when designing an app that will be of use to them, solving issues our team was passionate about.

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Preparing all the intricacies of the app were difficult considering there were many nuances, however we settled this by giving each person a niche role to ensure we got the project done on time and be proud of it.
