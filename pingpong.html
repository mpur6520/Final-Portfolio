            <h1>PING PONG GAME</h1>
            <p>In my Junior year Python & Programming class, our teacher introduced us to what Python can do by showcasing various games and breaking down the code. This is the result.</p>

                <h3>NOTES</h3>
                <p>You may need to fork the repl once you open it in order to view the code or play the game. This was done JUNIOR year.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on my Python skills by being consistently introduced to aspects of the programming language I was unfamiliar with in the past. As I've only focused on HTML/CSS, it was a fun change.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Figuring out how the code worked was difficult at first, but it clicked after asking extensive questions and breaking down the code line by line. Outside research also prepared me when it came to creating this.</p>
