            <h2>ABOUT ME - ASHLEY "MARU" PURAN</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ashley Puran, but many call me Maru. For starters, I'm a senior at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. As for some more background information, I love taking photos, I draw and I'm a member of the National Honors Society. My interests include story-analysis, game creation, and designing. Other than that I'm very invested in psychology and want to pursue a minor in it when I go to college, wanting to understand more about the world around me and connect to more people.</p>

                <h2>EXPERIENCES</h2>
                <p>As a senior in high school, I take in the world of app design and development. My CTE classes not only equipped me with foundational knowledge but also fostered my passion for creating innovative solutions through technology. Through hands-on projects and collaborative learning, I've been able to meet many people who've shared their experiences in computer science, taking that knowledge with me.
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, I've also worked on various projects for contests such as <a href="infyapp.html" target="_blank">LeafFree App</a>, <a href="congApp.html" target="_blank">SoulSearch</a>, and <a href="emoticon.html" target="_blank">EcoMuncher</a>, all linked in the PROJECTS menu, utilizing my knowledge of app development and programming. These projects have allowed me to gain valuable experience in the field. At the same time, I've been working at internships and volunteer opportunities, creating websites and gaining an understanding of what occurs in a business when contemplating the creation of websites.
                <br><br>
                All these opportunities granted to me creates a conglomerate of the skills I have today, which I hope to continue to develop and expand upon.

                <h2>JOURNEY</h2>
                <p><p>When I was a kid, I've always had a fascination with technology and would constantly look at the various things my dad brought home from his job. From then, I wasn't very exposed to the world of programming until fourth grade when my mother started doing it, including me on her small but significant journey with a book about javascript. Those days consisted of typing words I didn't truly understand into a programming compiler, staring in awe as it "magically" knew what I wanted it to do. That was when I knew computer science, specifically programming, was something I'd want to do.
                        <br><br>
                        After that, I enrolled in Thomas A. Edison CTE High School, where I took Computer Science Principles course to really understand what I was working it. In that class I met people, understood the basics of programming, and learned how to make websites. I've been able to make and design them in a way that, for a beginner, I was very proud of. This takes me a year later to my current Junior year where I've had the pleasure of coding different websites and apps. It garners me a good understanding of how much I've come since those simple days of following a book, and who I am today.

                <h2>SKILLS</h2>
                <p>For two years I've studied HTML-CSS and for one Python, passing both IT Specialist exams for each respective subject provided by <a href="https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/" target="_blank"><u>CERTIPORT</u></a> I am able to code basic websites from scratch and understand how to make certain games and animations, showcased in the PROJECTS menu located at the top of the page. Simultaneously, my more technical skills include coding, debugging, and designing.
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, I also have skills regarding UX/UI design through <a href="https://create.mouse.org/" target="_blank">MOUSE</a> understand what goes into making an app. Throughout internships and hands-on projects granted by my school, I have collaboratively worked on apps and games you can also see in the PROJECTS menu. In this case, I have skills pertaining to user understanding, social problems and idea generation, and comprehending the different ways technology can be utilized to solve problems in the real world.
                <br><br>
                To summarize, my skills include problem-solving, creativity, team-collaboration and time-management, HTML, CSS, Python, and a bit of Javascript.
