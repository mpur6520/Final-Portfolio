            <h1>EARSKETCH RINGTONE</h1>
            <p>EarSketch is a program that combines both Python and music, making it so that you have to code the music out instead of either playing or using MIDI. It was difficult for me to get used to, however I was able to complete the assignment.</p>

                <h3>NOTES</h3>
                <p>You may need to click on the green PLAY button at the top of the screen. If it does not work the first time, try again. This was done JUNIOR year.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>This was the first time I've ever used EarSketch and while I'm not very happy with the end result, it was something I felt accomplished for because I actually completed it.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>Compared to an actual DAW, the controls were much harder to understand as there was no real guide for it. It was a lot of guessing, but I did learn how certain snippets of code worked.</p>
