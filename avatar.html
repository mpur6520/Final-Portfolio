            <h1>AVATAR PROJECT</h1>
            <p>The project I made was based on stylized icons. The image I created is something I'm very proud of, to the point where I've also decided to utilize it as this website's favicon. Though there was some inconsistency with the concept of coding an actual person, compared to a landscape which I thought would be easier, I was able to complete it. Overall, I'm proud of the end product.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on my animation skills. It garnered me a better understanding of how Python can be utilized in the real world as well as how 2D graphics work.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>The houses were a big struggle for me. Through mentorship from my teacher, I was able to establish the pattern of houses randomly utilizing the random library.</p>
