                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>I enjoyed the Ghost School project as a whole, particularly because I was super interested in RPG-like games at the time. The pixel-art style was nostalgic to me because of the type of games I grew up around, and so I wanted to put my best effort into a project that reflected that with the skills I had at the time.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>I was focused on everything being perfectly aligned which led me to become frustrated and give up numerous times before tackling the issue again. This was a project where I learned perfection isn't imminent and I shouldn't chase it on my first attempt. I did what I could and I'm proud.</p>
