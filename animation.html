            <h1>ANIMATION PROJECT</h1>
            <p>The project I made was based on the quote “there’s a light at the end of every tunnel” by Ada Adams. I’m proud of myself for this concept and even if coding houses’ animation was difficult, I’m pleasantly surprised by the end result. I’ll refer to this when considering things I did right and wrong in retrospect to the animating and creation process. This was done entirely with Python, utilizing the compiler CodeSkulptor3 to piece it all together.</p>

                <h3>NOTES</h3>
                <p>Click on PLAY, the first green button beneath the CodeSkulptor3 title. You can also drag the animation window, where it says TESTER, to be more viewable. This was done JUNIOR year.</p>

                <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                <p>Through this project, I've improved on my animation skills. It garnered me a better understanding of how Python can be utilized in the real world as well as how 2D graphics work.</p>

                <h3>STRUGGLES</h3>
                <p>The houses were a big struggle for me. Through mentorship from my teacher, I was able to establish the pattern of houses randomly utilizing the random library.</p>
